# Hello
This rep at this moment for my web-dev study. 
It have collection of funny little exercises or my stupid coding ideas. 

For example, what gonna happen if i make ten billoin loops generaiting random number trying to make four 42 in a row. 

Fun. I know. 

It took 1.8 billion loops and 12 seconds. Computers are fast.
